Tests are written in the Ruby programming language using the
Test::Unit framework. The Parslet library is used to parse responses
from the Stunt server under test.

To run the tests:

1) Ensure you have Ruby 1.9.3 or later installed.

2) Ensure you have Bundler installed.

3) Install dependencies.
    bundle install

4) Create the following symlinks in the executables/ directory:
    ln -s `which echo` echo
    ln -s `which sleep` sleep
    ln -s `which true` true

5) Build the server and copy the executable into the test directory. Verify the settings in test.yml are accurate for your options.

6) In one console/terminal/window, run the Stunt server in the test directory:
    ./moo Test.db /dev/null 9898

7) In another console/terminal/window, run the tests:
    make tests

8) Delete the moo binary from the test directory when done.
